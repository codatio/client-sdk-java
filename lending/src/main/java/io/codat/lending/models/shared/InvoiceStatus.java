/**
 * InvoiceStatus - Current state of the invoice:
 * 
 * - `Draft` - Invoice hasn't been submitted to the supplier. It may be in a pending state or is scheduled for future submission, for example by email.
 * - `Submitted` - Invoice is no longer a draft. It has been processed and, or, sent to the customer. In this state, it will impact the ledger. It also has no payments made against it (amountDue == totalAmount).
 * - `PartiallyPaid` - The balance paid against the invoice is positive, but less than the total invoice amount (0 &lt; amountDue &lt; totalAmount).
 * - `Paid` - Invoice is paid in full. This includes if the invoice has been credited or overpaid (amountDue == 0).
 * - `Void` - An invoice can become Void when it's deleted, refunded, written off, or cancelled. A voided invoice may still be PartiallyPaid, and so all outstanding amounts on voided invoices are removed from the accounts receivable account.
