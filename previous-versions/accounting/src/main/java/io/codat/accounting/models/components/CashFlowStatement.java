         * When syncing data that contains `DateTime` fields from Codat, make sure you support the following cases when reading time information:
         * 
         * - Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): `2021-11-15T06:00:00Z`
         * - Unqualified local time: `2021-11-15T01:00:00`
         * - UTC time offsets: `2021-11-15T01:00:00-05:00`
         * 
         * &gt; Time zones
         * &gt; 
         * &gt; Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
         * &gt; Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.
